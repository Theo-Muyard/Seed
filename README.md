# Seed

> Seed is not a complete IDE, it's a seed.

Seed does not try to guess what the user wants.
It makes no assumptions about languages, workflows, or appearance.

It only provides :
- A minimal core, reliable and fast.
- Fertile ground: a clear and readable configuration system.
- An initial seed, sufficient to start, impossible to remove.

**Everything else grows.**

Themes, shortcuts, behaviors, tools, UI:
these are not “features,” they are consequences of configuration.

Seed never grows on its own.
It only becomes complex if the user decides to make it so.

> **Seed - A minimal core, infinite growth.**
